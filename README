Python implementation of bayesian global optimization with gaussian processes.

This is a constrained global optimization package built upon bayesian inference and
gaussian process, that attempts to find the maximum value of an unknown function in
as few iterations as possible. This technique is particularly suited for optimization
of high cost functions, situations where the balance between exploration and
exploitation is important.
